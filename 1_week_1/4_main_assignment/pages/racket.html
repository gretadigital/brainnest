        Introducing the Blade 98 16x19 v8! For this version Wilson adds some
        speed and stability while keeping the sublime feel and spin-friendly
        targeting of the previous generation. At 11.3 strung and boasting a
        speedy sub 320-RDC swingweight, this racquet is ideal for intermediate
        and advanced players, especially if they crave maneuverability. This
        stick also packs a buttery 61-RA stiffness, giving it outstanding ball
        feedback. For 2021 Wilson keeps the revolutionary layup technology that
        was originally used in the Blade v7 under the name FeelFlex. It’s now
        called FortyFive and, in addition to increasing stability, it helps the
        racquet bend in ways that compliment the modern game. For this update,
        Wilson also introduces Direct Connect Technology which fuses the butt
        cap directly to the carbon fiber portion of the handle for added
        stability. Additional updates include Wilson’s new Chameleon Paint which
        activates subtle color changes under different angles and light
        conditions. Experienced players looking for speed, spin, precision and
        feel should love this one.
