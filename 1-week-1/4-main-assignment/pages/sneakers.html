        There are a plethora of lightweight, speed-oriented performance shoes on
        the market, but not many can do what the Solution Speed FF 2 does! It
        remains light while still maintaining a high level of support, plus
        cushioning for the most aggressive movers. The FlyteFoam midsole
        provides a smooth, plush ride while the Twisstruss system helps with
        stability for ultra-aggressive lateral cuts. One key improvement our
        testers found was the Flexion Fit upper material which contours to the
        foot better than before making movement seamless. Durability has been
        improved with added protection to the medial side for hard court
        sliders. The outsole provides a nice blend of grip, while not feeling
        overly sticky, catering to speedy players, like Alex de Minaur, who
        slide into their shots on gritty hard courts.
