        Introducing Triax! With its multifilament construction, this string does
        not skimp on comfort. What separates this very arm-friendly string from
        the competition is thatit also hashigher levels of control, making it
        suitable to bigger hitters. Tecnifibre achieves this control partly
        through an innovative construction that integrates firm polyester
        filaments with softer polyamide (nylon) filaments. Triax also gives you
        the benefit a Silicon Pyrogene Lubritec (SPL) coating, a feature that
        not only helps it snap back for extra spin but also gives it some
        protection against the frictional wear that leads to breakage.On the
        court, our team found it to play firmer and crisper than a typical
        multifilament but it still managed to deliver arm-friendly comfort with
        impressive pocketing. You'll also appreciate the fact that it does not
        require constant straightening (like the majority of traditional
        multifilaments). In addition to being a solid option for the
        multifilament player who wants more control, spin-potential and
        durability, Triax will also tempt the big hitting poly player who wants
        a more tendon-friendly option.
